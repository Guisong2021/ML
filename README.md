### Pyhon codes for machine learning with logistic regression, Random forest and Extreme gradient boosting. Performed model selection and feature selection from training cohort first, then Built the selected models with the selected features from training cohort, applied to the testing and validation cohort,  and performed performance evaluation with ROC
